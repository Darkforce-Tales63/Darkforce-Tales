        <h2>The Whispering Forest</h2>

        <p>
            Deep within the northern edge of the old kingdom lies a forest untouched by time. Locals call it the Whispering Forest, a name whispered with trembling lips, for the trees themselves seem to murmur at night. Every traveler who passes near its borders claims to hear faint voices drifting through the wind—soft, eerie, and strangely human.
        </p>

        <p>
            Legends say the forest once belonged to an ancient tribe that vanished without a trace. Their spirits, bound to the trees, wander endlessly between the shadows. The wind carries their regrets, their warnings, and sometimes… their anger. It is said that no one who enters after sunset ever returns unchanged.
        </p>

        <p>
            One autumn night, a young wanderer named Lorian arrived in the nearby village. He was tired, hungry, and seeking shelter, but the villagers were reluctant to speak to him. Only once he mentioned the Whispering Forest did their silence break—though not in the way he expected. Eyes widened, hands trembled, and the old innkeeper begged him not to go near it.
        </p>

        <p>
            But Lorian was different. He had spent years chasing myths and forgotten legends. Something about the forest called to him—not with fear, but with curiosity. He felt a strange pull, as if the trees were beckoning him. That night, unable to resist, he set out toward the forest’s edge, guided only by the crimson glow of the setting moon.
        </p>

        <p>
            As he entered, the air chilled instantly. The forest was unnaturally quiet, as if every creature held its breath. Leaves rustled faintly above him, though there was no wind. Then he heard it—soft whispers, too clear to be normal wind. They brushed past his ears, forming words he almost understood. “Go back… go back…” they murmured.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lorian pressed deeper, and the trees seemed to shift around him. Their twisted branches tangled overhead like skeletal hands. The path beneath him faded into darkness, and he realized the forest was guiding him—or trapping him. The whispers grew louder, more desperate. Some pleaded with him to turn around, while others invited him further with chilling gentleness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suddenly, a figure appeared in the distance, shrouded in mist. Lorian froze. It was tall, thin, and its face was hidden beneath a wooden mask carved with ancient runes. The figure raised an arm slowly, pointing deeper into the woods. The whispers around Lorian shifted instantly—from warnings to a unified command: “Follow… follow…”
        </p>

        <p>
            Against his own instinct, Lorian walked. The figure faded backward, always the same distance ahead, never closer. Hours seemed to pass, though his legs never tired. The forest grew colder, thicker, alive with whispers that felt like fingers brushing against his skin. Then the figure stopped beside a massive, ancient tree whose bark pulsed faintly like a heartbeat.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tree split open. Inside was a hollow chamber filled with thousands of flickering lights—spirits trapped in eternal glow. The whispers became screams, and the masked figure vanished into the light. Lorian felt the pull drag him forward. He realized too late the truth: the forest did not whisper to warn—it whispered to lure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next morning, the villagers found Lorian’s belongings at the forest’s edge, but no trace of him. At night, when the wind blows cold, new whispers drift from the trees—faint, pained, and unfamiliar. They say a new voice has joined the forest… calling out to anyone who dares to enter.
